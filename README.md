# Week 5 Challenge: Password_Generator

Javascript code for Password Generator App

## Overview

The week 5 challenge required me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. The application runs in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

Features of the application are described below:

* Generate a password when the button "Generate Password" is clicked

  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.

    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)

  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected

  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
